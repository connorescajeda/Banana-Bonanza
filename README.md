# Banana Bonanza, my first coding project

## What is it?
Banana Bonanza is an idle clicker game or otherwise known as an incremental game.
[If you want to know more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)
The core idea of the game is to generate as many bananas as possible until you have accumulated enough
to buy the "Banana Takeover" which causes the bananas to perform a hostile takeover. Once you have realized your banana
greed went to far the world offers you another chance to restart but with the ability to make bananas even quicker now.
While you think you'd learn your lesson, you just keep making bananas even faster.

### What was used in the making?
I used a Python package called "pygame" which allows for many features that make creating games
a lot easier. It includes things such as event objects to create detectors for things like mouse clicks or scrolls.


### Interesting features
The tools I had at my disposal when I created this game weren't exactly the most user friendly for graphics or
user interaction so I had a lot of challenges with creating something as simple as a button. The buttons within this
game are completely created by me as their own object class. The other really difficult thing is that anytime anything on the screen needs to change I have to make sure that everything gets redrawn on the screen so nothing is static on the screen. Everything has to get dynamically put on each time you get a banana or the timer counts up. Yes, very inefficient but like I said these were the only tools at my disposal.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, I really enjoyed the time I had when I was making this. It is what made me fall in love with programming and computer science and is a huge reason I am on the path I am on. I hope one day to get the time to come back and create another incremental game and see just how far I have come from my first real project. I hope you enjoyed seeing my first real creation.

* This is what happens when you buy the Banana Takeover building, and if you see it offers you the chance to restart in the middle.

* This is what happens when you have returned to a new universe, if you notice the buildings now all create more bananas than the last.
